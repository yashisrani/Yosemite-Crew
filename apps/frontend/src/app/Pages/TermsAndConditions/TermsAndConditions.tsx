        <ul className="definitions__list">
          <li>
            <strong>15.1.</strong> DuneXploration shall be liable in accordance
            with the applicable statutory provisions (whether in contract, tort
            or otherwise) for damages suffered by the Customer that (i) have
            been caused as a result of DuneXploration, its legal
            representatives, its agents or auxiliaries having acted, or having
            failed to act where there was a duty for DuneXploration to act, in
            gross negligence or with wilful or malicious intent; (ii) have
            occurred as a result of a breach of a guarantee (the term
            “guarantee” in accordance with the applicable statutory meaning);
            (iii) are a result of a culpably caused injury to life, limb or
            health; and/or (iv) are subject to product liability under the
            German Product Liability Act.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>15.2.</strong> In cases of negligence other than gross
            negligence, DuneXploration shall only be liable for damages that
            result from breaches of material contractual obligations. This
            limitation of liability shall not apply, however, where the damages
            result from culpably caused injuries to life, limb or health or a
            breach of a guarantee (as defined in Section 15.1). “Material
            contractual obligations” are such contractual obligations that, if
            breached, jeopardize the aim and purpose of the contract, and are
            such that the other contractual party may generally rely on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>15.3.</strong> In cases of negligence other than gross
            negligence, DuneXploration’s liability shall also be limited to
            damages that are typically foreseeable in the context of an
            agreement such as this Agreement. This limitation of liability
            shall, however, likewise not apply where the damages result from
            culpably caused injuries to life, limb or health or a breach of a
            guarantee (as defined in Section 15.1).

            injuries to life, limb or health or a breach of a guarantee (as
            defined above):

                <strong>15.4.2.</strong> DuneXploration’s aggregate liability

                aggregate Fees paid or payable by the Customer to DuneXploration
                in the twelve (12) calendar months prior to the event giving
                rise to the liability; or (b) 5,000 EUR.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>15.6.</strong> The Customer is responsible for ensuring the
            routine backup of its data. Irrespective of Sections 15.1 to 15.3,
            if the Customer suffers damages that result from the loss of data,
            DuneXploration shall in each case only be liable for such damages
            insofar as the damages could not have been avoided by the Customer
            carrying out data backups of all relevant data in regular intervals
            according to good industry practice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Damage claims, irrespective of their legal origin and nature
            (contract, tort or other), shall fall under the statute of
            limitations one year after the end of the calendar year during which
            the claims came into existence and the Customer knew or should have
            reasonably known the factual circumstances that gave rise to the
            claim. The foregoing sentence shall, however, not apply where the
            damage has been caused by, or has not been remedied with or because
            of, DuneXploration’s wilful intent, where DuneXploration had
            maliciously concealed a defect in the Products, in cases of injuries
            to life, limb or health, and/or where the corresponding claims
            result from the German Product Liability Act.

          Updates, other software modifications or additions, procedures, or
          routine or configuration changes that may solve, bypass or eliminate
          the practical adverse effect of the Error. Customer will designate a

          Customer Support Center, and submit Errors, requests or support
          tickets (the <strong>“Technical Support Contacts”</strong>). Customer
          is permitted to name as many Technical Contacts as allowed pursuant to
          the purchased Support Service Subscription. Customer’s non-named
          Technical Contacts may contact the Customer Support Center only in
          case of an emergency or on an exception basis, and DuneXploration will
          respond to such Error submission and cooperate with the non-named
          Technical Contact, subject to later verification and involvement of a
          named Technical Support Contact. Additional named Technical Support
          Contacts may be permitted upon mutual agreement of the parties.

        <p>
          <strong>5.1.</strong> If DuneXploration does not meet the Uptime
          levels specified below, Customer will be entitled, upon written
          request, to a service level credit (“Service Level Credit”) to be
          calculated as follows:
        </p>

        <ul className="doc-list">
          <li>
            If Uptime Percentage is at least 99.995% of the month’s minutes, no

          </li>
          <li>
            If Uptime Percentage is 99.75% to 99.94% (inclusive) of the month’s

            If Uptime Percentage is 99.50% to 99.74% (inclusive) of the month’s

          <li>
            If Uptime Percentage is less than 99.50% of the month’s minutes,

            fee derived from one-twelfth (1/12th) of the then-current annual fee
            paid to DuneXploration.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>5.2.</strong> Customer shall only be eligible to request
          Service Level Credits if it notifies DuneXploration in writing within
          thirty (30) days from the end of the month for which Service Level
          Credits are due. All claims will be verified against DuneXploration’s
          system records. In the event after such notification DuneXploration
          determines that Service Level Credits are not due, or that different
          Service Level Credits are due, DuneXploration shall notify Customer in
          writing on that finding. Service Level Credits will be applied to the
          next invoice following Customer’s request and DuneXploration’s
          confirmation of available credits. Service Level Credits shall be
          Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy in the event of any failure to
          meet the Service Levels. DuneXploration will only provide records of
          system availability in response to good faith Customer claims.

          The Parties have concluded the “Yosemite Crew License and Subscription

          Customer. For the performance of the services, it is necessary that
          the Processor processes personal data for and on behalf of the
          Controller. The purpose of this agreement is to stipulate the
          obligations of the parties in connection with any processing of
          personal data by Processor as data processor on behalf of Controller
          as data controller.

          <li>
            The Parties conclude the Standard Contractual Clauses between
            controllers and processors as agreed upon by the European Commission
            in its Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/915 of June 4 2021
            and attached to this DPA as APPENDIX 1 (the “EU-Standard Contractual
            Clauses”). For clarity, Processor’s obligations and Controller’s
            rights concerning Personal Data apply even if the Personal Data
            relates to a data subject outside the European Union.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Parties agree upon including Clause 5 of the Standard
            Contractual Clauses and use OPTION 2 of Clause 7.7 regarding the
            general authorization of sub processors, whereas the time period in
            Clause 7.7 shall be 2 weeks. Regarding any other OPTIONS to choose
            from in the Clauses of the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Parties
            in each case agree upon OPTION 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Parties conclude the Standard Contractual Clauses, MODULE 4
            (Processor to Controller) for the transfer of personal data to third
            countries pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as agreed upon by the
            European Commission in its Commission Implementing Decision (EU)
            2021/914 of 4 June 2021 and attached to this DPA as APPENDIX 2 (the
            “International Standard Contractual Clauses”). Regarding Clause 17
            and Clause 18 (applicable law and jurisdiction) Germany is chosen
            each time. ANNEX 1 and 2 of APPENDIX 1 apply accordingly to describe
            the roles and the processing of personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            The EU-Standard Contractual Clauses and International Standard
            Contractual Clauses will be supplemented by the provisions of this
            DPA.
          </li>
          <li>
            If any clause from this DPA or the Yosemite Crew License and
            Subscription Terms (SaaS) or any other related agreement between the
            Parties directly or indirectly contradicts the EU-Standard
            Contractual Clauses or International Standard Contractual Clauses,
            the respective Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail. If any
            clause from the EU-Standard Contractual Clauses directly or
            indirectly contradicts the International Standard Contractual
            Clauses, the International Standard Contractual Clauses shall

        <h4 className="doc-section-title">2. Instructions of the Controller</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The Controller’s initial instructions shall be set out by the
            provisions of the Yosemite Crew License and Subscription Terms
            (SaaS), its Annexes and Appendices and any related agreement.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Controller shall be entitled to modify, amend or replace such
            individual instructions by issuing new instructions to the point of
            contact designated by the Processor. The instruction shall be given
            either in written form (email to suffice). In case of an oral
            instruction, the Controller shall immediately confirm this
            instruction in written form (email to suffice).
          </li>
          <li>
            Instructions not foreseen in or covered by the Yosemite Crew License
            and Subscription Terms (SaaS) shall be treated as requests for
            change in performance. The Controller shall immediately confirm in
            writing or in text form any instruction issued orally.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4 className="doc-section-title">
          3. Technical and Organisational Measures
        </h4>
        <p>
          In Cases where the EU-Standard Contractual Clauses apply, the
          Processor has the right to amend or modify the technical and
          organisational measures that are set out in the DPA and its APPENDICES
          and ANNEXES at any time, provided, however, that the level of security
          shall not fall below the level initially agreed upon.

            of personal data detected by the Controller.
          </li>

          <p>d. Annexes I to IV are an integral part of the Clauses.</p>
          <p>

            controller is subject by virtue of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and/or
            Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            b. This does not prevent the Parties from including the standard
            contractual clauses laid down in these Clauses in a broader
            contract, or from adding other clauses or additional safeguards
            provided that they do not directly or indirectly contradict the

          <p>
            a. The processor shall process personal data only on documented
            instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union
            or Member State law to which the processor is subject. In this case,
            the processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement
            before processing, unless the law prohibits this on important
            grounds of public interest. Subsequent instructions may also be
            given by the controller throughout the duration of the processing of
            personal data. These instructions shall always be documented.
          </p>
          <p>
            b. The processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in the
            processor’s opinion, instructions given by the controller infringe
            Regulation (EU) 2016/679 / Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 or the

          <p>
            The processor shall process the personal data only for the specific
            purpose(s) of the processing, as set out in Annex II, unless it
            receives further instructions from the controller.

            Processing by the processor shall only take place for the duration
            specified in Annex II.
          </p>

          <div className="clause">7.4. Security of processing</div>
          <p>
            a. The processor shall at least implement the technical and
            organisational measures specified in Annex III to ensure the
            security of the personal data. This includes protecting the data
            against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful
            destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to
            the data (personal data breach). In assessing the appropriate level
            of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the
            art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and
            purposes of processing and the risks involved for the data subjects.
          </p>
          <p>
            b. The processor shall grant access to the personal data undergoing
            processing to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly
            necessary for implementing, managing and monitoring of the contract.
            The processor shall ensure that persons authorised to process the
            personal data received have committed themselves to confidentiality
            or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.

          <div className="clause">7.5. Sensitive data</div>
          <p>
            If the processing involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic
            origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or
            trade union membership, genetic data or biometric data for the
            purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning
            health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data
            relating to criminal convictions and offences (“sensitive data”),
            the processor shall apply specific restrictions and/or additional
            safeguards.
          </p>

          <div className="clause">7.6. Documentation and compliance</div>
          <p>
            a. The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these
            Clauses.
          </p>
          <p>
            b. The processor shall deal promptly and adequately with inquiries
            from the controller about the processing of data in accordance with
            these Clauses.
          </p>
          <p>
            c. The processor shall make available to the controller all
            information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations
            that are set out in these Clauses and stem directly from Regulation
            (EU) 2016/679 and/or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. At the controller’s
            request, the processor shall also permit and contribute to audits of
            the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable
            intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding
            on a review or an audit, the controller may take into account
            relevant certifications held by the processor.
          </p>
          <p>
            d. The controller may choose to conduct the audit by itself or
            mandate an independent auditor. Audits may also include inspections
            at the premises or physical facilities of the processor and shall,
            where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            e. The Parties shall make the information referred to in this
            Clause, including the results of any audits, available to the
            competent supervisory authority/ies on request.

          <div className="clause">7.7. Use of sub-processors</div>
          <p>
            a. OPTION 1: PRIOR SPECIFIC AUTHORISATION: The processor shall not
            subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of
            the controller in accordance with these Clauses to a sub-processor,
            without the controller’s prior specific written authorisation. The
            processor shall submit the request for specific authorisation at
            least [SPECIFY TIME PERIOD] prior to the engagement of the
            sub-processor in question, together with the information necessary
            to enable the controller to decide on the authorisation. The list of
            sub-processors authorised by the controller can be found in Annex
            IV. The Parties shall keep Annex IV up to date.
          </p>
          <p>
            OPTION 2: GENERAL WRITTEN AUTHORISATION: The processor has the
            controller’s general authorisation for the engagement of
            sub-processors from an agreed list. The processor shall specifically
            inform in writing the controller of any intended changes of that
            list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least
            [SPECIFY TIME PERIOD] in advance, thereby giving the controller
            sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the
            engagement of the concerned sub-processor(s). The processor shall
            provide the controller with the information necessary to enable the
            controller to exercise the right to object.
          </p>
          <p>
            b. Where the processor engages a sub-processor for carrying out
            specific processing activities (on behalf of the controller), it
            shall do so by way of a contract which imposes on the sub-processor,
            in substance, the same data protection obligations as the ones
            imposed on the data processor in accordance with these Clauses. The
            processor shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the
            obligations to which the processor is subject pursuant to these
            Clauses and to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and/or Regulation (EU)
            2018/1725.
          </p>
          <p>
            c. At the controller’s request, the processor shall provide a copy
            of such a sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments to
            the controller. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets
            or other confidential information, including personal data, the
            processor may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing the
            copy.
          </p>
          <p >
            d. The processor shall remain fully responsible to the controller
            for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations in accordance
            with its contract with the processor. The processor shall notify the
            controller of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its
            contractual obligations.
          </p>
          <p>
            e. The processor shall agree a third party beneficiary clause with
            the sub-processor whereby - in the event the processor has factually
            disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent - the
            controller shall have the right to terminate the sub-processor
            contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the
            personal data.
          </p>

          <div className="clause">7.8. International transfers</div>
          <p>
            a. Any transfer of data to a third country or an international
            organisation by the processor shall be done only on the basis of
            documented instructions from the controller or in order to fulfil a
            specific requirement under Union or Member State law to which the
            processor is subject and shall take place in compliance with Chapter
            V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.
          </p>
          <p>
            b. The controller agrees that where the processor engages a
            sub-processor in accordance with Clause 7.7. for carrying out
            specific processing activities (on behalf of the controller) and
            those processing activities involve a transfer of personal data
            within the meaning of Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the
            processor and the sub-processor can ensure compliance with Chapter V
            of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 by using standard contractual clauses
            adopted by the Commission in accordance with of Article 46(2) of
            Regulation (EU) 2016/679, provided the conditions for the use of
            those standard contractual clauses are met.

            Clause 8 - Assistance to the controller
          </div>
          <p>
            a. The processor shall promptly notify the controller of any request
            it has received from the data subject. It shall not respond to the
            request itself, unless authorised to do so by the controller.
          </p>
          <p>
            b. The processor shall assist the controller in fulfilling its
            obligations to respond to data subjects’ requests to exercise their
            rights, taking into account the nature of the processing. In
            fulfilling its obligations in accordance with (a) and (b), the

            assist the controller in ensuring compliance with the following
            obligations, taking into account the nature of the data processing
            and the information available to the processor:

              is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of
              natural persons;
            </li>
            <li>
              the obligation to consult the competent supervisory authority/ies
              prior to processing where a data protection impact assessment
              indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the
              absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk;
            </li>
            <li>
              the obligation to ensure that personal data is accurate and up to
              date, by informing the controller without delay if the processor
              becomes aware that the personal data it is processing is
              inaccurate or has become outdated;

            and/or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, in the event that the processor is
            in breach of its obligations under these Clauses, the controller may
            instruct the processor to suspend the processing of personal data
            until the latter complies with these Clauses or the contract is
            terminated. The processor shall promptly inform the controller in
            case it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.

              The processing of personal data by the processor has been

              Regulation (EU) 2018/1725;

              the processor fails to comply with a binding decision of a

            delete existing copies unless Union or Member State law requires
            storage of the personal data. Until the data is deleted or returned,

                <br />
                Our systems are built on AWS using secure, highly available
                cloud architecture. We use encryption (TLS & AES-256),
                least-privilege IAM roles RBAC methodology, and network
                isolation to protect data. We use GitHub for secure source
                control, with enforced code reviews, signed commits, and audit
                logging to ensure code integrity: All changes are
                version-controlled, tested, and logged via CloudTrail to
                maintain integrity. Backups, regular disaster recovery tests,
                and alignment with AWS Well-Architected Framework ensure we stay
                resilient under pressure or failure. Continuous vulnerability
                management, container scans, weekly patched AMIs backup, annual
                VAPT penetration test.

                (RBAC) Role based access control: We use role-based access
                control (RBAC) to make sure each person only sees the data they
                need for their job – right down to individual rows in the
                database if needed. We don’t allow shared logins, so every
                action can be clearly traced to a specific user. Session
                management – We manage user sessions securely using encrypted
                tokens. If someone’s inactive for 15 minutes, they’re logged out
                automatically, and all sessions end after 12 hours no matter
                what — this helps reduce the risk from forgotten or unattended
                logins.

                <br />
                All data on AWS cloud instances volumes are encrypted using the
                latest and most secure standard. We’ve disabled older, weaker
                encryption methods to keep communications safe. For our mobile
                apps, we use certificate pinning to make sure the app only talks
                to our real servers — this helps prevent man-in-the-middle
                attacks. In sensitive industries like healthcare or legal, we
                offer full end-to-end encryption so that even we can’t see the
                data in transit. When it comes to file transfers, we use secure
                methods like SFTP with strong SSH keys or short-lived HTTPS
                download links that session ends after 30 minutes to prevent
                unauthorized access.

                <br />
                We track all key activities across our systems using AWS
                CloudWatch and GitHub audit logs. In AWS, CloudWatch logs cover
                everything from API calls and network activity to system
                performance and security events. Combined with services like
                CloudTrail and GuardDuty, this helps us detect and respond to
                threats quickly. On the development side, GitHub audit logs let
                us monitor actions like code pushes, permission changes, and
                access to repositories — ensuring we have full traceability of
                who did what, and when. All logs are stored securely, protected
                from tampering, and kept according to our retention policy. We
                review them regularly and have automated alerts for anything
                suspicious, so our security team can act fast if something’s not
                right.

                the necessary services and ports enabled. Encryption is turned
                on by default, and insecure protocols are disabled. We regularly
                apply security updates and critical API patches, so we don’t
                fall behind. System settings are continuously monitored to catch
                any drift from our secure baseline.

                We generally do not store personal data unless it’s strictly

                review to ensure we’re limiting the type, amount, and duration
                of personal data used. Where possible, we replace identifiers

                to make sure data protection and security responsibilities are
                clear, monitored, and auditable. All roles and responsibilities

                Steering Committee. We maintain detailed records of processing
                activities (RoPA) and conduct regular internal audits to ensure

              We carefully vet all sub-processors before working with them,
              especially when they handle personal data on our behalf. Each
              sub-processor must sign a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) that
              clearly sets out their responsibilities, including support for the
              controller’s obligations under GDPR. Sub-processors are required
              to implement equivalent technical and organisational measures as
              we do — including encryption of data in transit and at rest,
              access controls, security logging, and staff training. We also
              require that they only process data under documented instructions
              and never for their own purposes. To ensure transparency and
              compliance: Sub-processors must promptly assist us (and therefore
              the controller) with requests from data subjects, such as access,
              rectification, or deletion. They must notify us of any data breach
              without undue delay, allowing us to meet the 72-hour GDPR
              notification window. They are required to undergo regular security
              audits (ISO 27001 or SOC 2) and provide evidence on request.

              the data importer. In the latter case, the data importer shall, to
              the extent possible, make the information publicly available.
              <br />
              c. On request, the Parties shall make a copy of these Clauses,
              including the Appendix as completed by them, available to the data
              subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect
              business secrets or other confidential information, including
              personal data, the Parties may redact part of the text of the
              Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful
              summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to
              understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the
              Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the
              redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted
              information.
              <br />
              d. Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligations
              of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU)
              2016/679.
              <br />
              8.3 Accuracy and data minimisation
              <br />
              a. Each Party shall ensure that the personal data is accurate and,
              where necessary, kept up to date. The data importer shall take
              every reasonable step to ensure that personal data that is
              inaccurate, having regard to the purpose(s) of processing, is
              erased or rectified without delay.
              <br />
              b. If one of the Parties becomes aware that the personal data it
              has transferred or received is inaccurate, or has become outdated,
              it shall inform the other Party without undue delay.
              <br />
              c. The data importer shall ensure that the personal data is
              adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to
              the purpose(s) of processing.
              <br />
              8.4 Storage limitation
              <br />
              The data importer shall retain the personal data for no longer
              than necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is processed. It
              shall put in place appropriate technical or organisational
              measures to ensure compliance with this obligation, including
              erasure or anonymisation (2) of the data and all back-ups at the
              end of the retention period.
              <br />
              8.5 Security of processing
              <br />
              a. The data importer and, during transmission, also the data
              exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational
              measures to ensure the security of the personal data, including
              protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or
              unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or
              access (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing the
              appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the
              state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope,
              context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the
              processing for the data subject. The Parties shall in particular
              consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation,
              including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can
              be fulfilled in that manner.
              <br />
              b. The Parties have agreed on the technical and organisational
              measures set out in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out
              regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide
              an appropriate level of security.
              <br />
              c. The data importer shall ensure that persons authorised to
              process the personal data have committed themselves to
              confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation
              of confidentiality.
              <br />
              d. In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data
              processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data
              importer shall take appropriate measures to address the personal
              data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse
              effects.
              <br />
              e. In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a
              risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data
              importer shall without undue delay notify both the data exporter
              and the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13.
              Such notification shall contain i) a description of the nature of
              the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate
              number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), ii)
              its likely consequences, iii) the measures taken or proposed to
              address the breach, and iv) the details of a contact point from
              whom more information can be obtained. To the extent it is not
              possible for the data importer to provide all the information at
              the same time, it may do so in phases without undue further delay.
              <br />
              f. In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a
              high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data
              importer shall also notify without undue delay the data subjects
              concerned of the personal data breach and its nature, if necessary
              in cooperation with the data exporter, together with the
              information referred to in paragraph (e), points ii) to iv),
              unless the data importer has implemented measures to significantly
              reduce the risk to the rights or freedoms of natural persons, or
              notification would involve disproportionate efforts. In the latter
              case, the data importer shall instead issue a public communication
              or take a similar measure to inform the public of the personal
              data breach.
              <br />
              g. The data importer shall document all relevant facts relating to
              the personal data breach, including its effects and any remedial
              action taken, and keep a record thereof.
              <br />
              8.6 Sensitive data
              <br />
              Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or
              ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
              beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric
              data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person,
              data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual
              orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions or offences
              (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply
              specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards adapted to the
              specific nature of the data and the risks involved. This may
              include restricting the personnel permitted to access the personal
              data, additional security measures (such as pseudonymisation)
              and/or additional restrictions with respect to further disclosure.
              <br />
              8.7 Onward transfers
              <br />
              The data importer shall not disclose the personal data to a third
              party located outside the European Union (3) (in the same country
              as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter
              ‘onward transfer’) unless the third party is or agrees to be bound
              by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module. Otherwise, an
              onward transfer by the data importer may only take place if: (i)
              it is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant
              to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward
              transfer; (ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate
              safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 of Regulation (EU)
              2016/679 with respect to the processing in question; (iii) the
              third party enters into a binding instrument with the data
              importer ensuring the same level of data protection as under these
              Clauses, and the data importer provides a copy of these safeguards
              to the data exporter; iv) it is necessary for the establishment,
              exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific
              administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; (v) it is
              necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data
              subject or of another natural person; or (vi) where none of the
              other conditions apply, the data importer has obtained the
              explicit consent of the data subject for an onward transfer in a
              specific situation, after having informed him/her of its
              purpose(s), the identity of the recipient and the possible risks
              of such transfer to him/her due to the lack of appropriate data
              protection safeguards. In this case, the data importer shall
              inform the data exporter and, at the request of the latter, shall
              transmit to it a copy of the information provided to the data
              subject. Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data
              importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in
              particular purpose limitation.

                <b>  8.8 Processing under the authority of the data importer</b>
                <br />
                The data importer shall ensure that any person acting under its
                authority, including a processor, processes the data only on its
                instructions.
                <br />
                <b>       8.9 Documentation and compliance</b>
                <br />

                a. Each Party shall be able to demonstrate compliance with its
                obligations under these Clauses. In particular, the data importer
                shall keep appropriate documentation of the processing activities
                carried out under its responsibility.
                <br />
                b. The data importer shall make such documentation available to
                the competent supervisory authority on request.

                MODULE TWO: Transfer controller to processor
              </strong>
              <br />
              8.1. Instructions
              <br />
              (a) The data importer shall process the personal data only on
              documented instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter
              may give such instructions throughout the duration of the
              contract.
              <br />
              (b) The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter
              if it is unable to follow those instructions.
              <br />
              8.2. Purpose limitation
              <br />
              The data importer shall process the personal data only for the
              specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B,
              unless on further instructions from the data exporter.
              <br />
              8.3. Transparency
              <br />
              On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses,
              including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to
              the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to
              protect business secrets or other confidential information,
              including the measures described in Annex II and personal data,
              the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to
              these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a
              meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be
              able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights. On
              request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the
              reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without
              revealing the redacted information. This Clause is without
              prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles
              13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
              <br />
              8.4. Accuracy
              <br />
              If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has
              received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform
              the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data
              importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or
              rectify the data.
              <br />
              8.5. Duration of processing and erasure or return of data
              <br />
              Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the
              duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of
              the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of
              the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of
              the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has
              done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data
              processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data
              is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure
              compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to
              the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal
              data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure
              compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the
              extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is
              without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for
              the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter
              throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to
              believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not
              in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).
              <br />
              8.6. Security of processing
              <br />
              a. The data importer and, during transmission, also the data
              exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational
              measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection
              against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful
              destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access
              to that data (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing
              the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due
              account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the
              nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks
              involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties
              shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or
              pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose
              of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of
              pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the
              personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible,
              remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In
              complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data
              importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational
              measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out
              regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide
              an appropriate level of security.
              <br />
              b. The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to
              members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for
              the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It
              shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data
              have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an
              appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
              <br />
              c. In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data
              processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data
              importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach,
              including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data
              importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay
              after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall
              contain the details of a contact point where more information can
              be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including,
              where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects
              and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and
              the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including,
              where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse
              effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide
              all information at the same time, the initial notification shall
              contain the information then available and further information
              shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without
              undue delay.
              <br />
              d. The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data
              exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its
              obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to
              notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data
              subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the
              information available to the data importer.
              <br />
              8.7. Sensitive data
              <br />
              Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or
              ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
              beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric
              data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person,
              data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual
              orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences
              (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the
              specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in
              Annex I.B.
              <br />
              8.8. Onward transfers
              <br />
              The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third
              party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In
              addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located
              outside the European Union (4) (in the same country as the data
              importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward
              transfer’) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these
              Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if: (i) the onward
              transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision
              pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the
              onward transfer; (ii) the third party otherwise ensures
              appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of
              (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question; (iii)
              the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise
              or defence of legal claims in the context of specific
              administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or (iv) the
              onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital
              interests of the data subject or of another natural person. Any
              onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with
              all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular
              purpose limitation.
              <br />
              8.9. Documentation and compliance
              <br />
              a. The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with
              enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the processing
              under these Clauses.
              <br />
              b. The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these
              Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate
              documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf
              of the data exporter.
              <br />
              c. The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all
              information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the
              obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter’s
              request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing
              activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if
              there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding on a review
              or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant
              certifications held by the data importer.
              <br />
              d. The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or
              mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at
              the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and
              shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.
              <br />
              e. The Parties shall make the information referred to in
              paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits,
              available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

                MODULE THREE: Transfer processor to processor
              </strong>
              <br />
              8.1. Instructions
              <br />
              a. The data exporter has informed the data importer that it acts
              as processor under the instructions of its controller(s), which
              the data exporter shall make available to the data importer prior
              to processing.
              <br />
              b. The data importer shall process the personal data only on
              documented instructions from the controller, as communicated to
              the data importer by the data exporter, and any additional
              documented instructions from the data exporter. Such additional
              instructions shall not conflict with the instructions from the
              controller. The controller or data exporter may give further
              documented instructions regarding the data processing throughout
              the duration of the contract.
              <br />
              c. The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if
              it is unable to follow those instructions. Where the data importer
              is unable to follow the instructions from the controller, the data
              exporter shall immediately notify the controller.
              <br />
              d. The data exporter warrants that it has imposed the same data
              protection obligations on the data importer as set out in the
              contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law
              between the controller and the data exporter (5).
              <br />
              8.2 Purpose limitation
              <br />
              The data importer shall process the personal data only for the
              specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B.,
              unless on further instructions from the controller, as
              communicated to the data importer by the data exporter, or from
              the data exporter.
              <br />
              8.3 Transparency
              <br />
              On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses,
              including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to
              the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to
              protect business secrets or other confidential information,
              including personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the
              text of the Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a
              meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be
              able to understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On
              request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the
              reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without
              revealing the redacted information.
              <br />
              8.4 Accuracy
              <br />
              If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has
              received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform
              the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data
              importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to rectify or
              erase the data.
              <br />
              8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data
              <br />
              Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the
              duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of
              the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of
              the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of
              the controller and certify to the data exporter that it has done
              so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on
              its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted
              or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance
              with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data
              importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data,
              the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure
              compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the
              extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is
              without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for
              the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter
              throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to
              believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not
              in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).
              <br />
              8.6 Security of processing
              <br />
              a. The data importer and, during transmission, also the data
              exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational
              measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection
              against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful
              destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access
              to that data (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing
              the appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of
              the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature,
              scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved
              in the processing for the data subject. The Parties shall in
              particular consider having recourse to encryption or
              pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose
              of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of
              pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the
              personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible,
              remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter or the
              controller. In complying with its obligations under this
              paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the
              technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The
              data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these
              measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.
              <br />
              b. The data importer shall grant access to the data to members of
              its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the
              implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It
              shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data
              have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an
              appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
              <br />
              c. In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data
              processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data
              importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach,
              including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data
              importer shall also notify, without undue delay, the data exporter
              and, where appropriate and feasible, the controller after having
              become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the
              details of a contact point where more information can be obtained,
              a description of the nature of the breach (including, where
              possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and
              personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the
              measures taken or proposed to address the data breach, including
              measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in
              so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the
              same time, the initial notification shall contain the information
              then available and further information shall, as it becomes
              available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.
              <br />
              d. The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data
              exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its
              obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to
              notify its controller so that the latter may in turn notify the
              competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects,
              taking into account the nature of processing and the information
              available to the data importer.
              <br />
              8.7 Sensitive data
              <br />
              Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or
              ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
              beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric
              data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person,
              data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual
              orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences
              (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the
              specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards set out in
              Annex I.B.
              <br />
              8.8 Onward transfers
              <br />
              The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third
              party on documented instructions from the controller, as
              communicated to the data importer by the data exporter. In
              addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located
              outside the European Union (6) (in the same country as the data
              importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward
              transfer’) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these
              Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if: (i) the onward
              transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision
              pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the
              onward transfer; (ii) the third party otherwise ensures
              appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 of Regulation
              (EU) 2016/679; (iii) the onward transfer is necessary for the
              establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context
              of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or
              (iv) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the
              vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
              Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer
              with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular
              purpose limitation.
              <br />
              8.9 Documentation and compliance
              <br />
              a. The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with
              enquiries from the data exporter or the controller that relate to
              the processing under these Clauses.
              <br />
              b. The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these
              Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate
              documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf
              of the controller.
              <br />
              c. The data importer shall make all information necessary to
              demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these
              Clauses available to the data exporter, which shall provide it to
              the controller.
              <br />
              d. The data importer shall allow for and contribute to audits by
              the data exporter of the processing activities covered by these
              Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of
              non-compliance. The same shall apply where the data exporter
              requests an audit on instructions of the controller. In deciding
              on an audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant
              certifications held by the data importer.
              <br />
              e. Where the audit is carried out on the instructions of the
              controller, the data exporter shall make the results available to
              the controller.
              <br />
              f. The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or
              mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at
              the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and
              shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.
              <br />
              g. The Parties shall make the information referred to in
              paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits,
              available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

              8.1 Instructions
              <br />
              a. The data exporter shall process the personal data only on
              documented instructions from the data importer acting as its
              controller.
              <br />
              b. The data exporter shall immediately inform the data importer if
              it is unable to follow those instructions, including if such
              instructions infringe Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or other Union or
              Member State data protection law.
              <br />
              c. The data importer shall refrain from any action that would
              prevent the data exporter from fulfilling its obligations under

              sub-processing or as regards cooperation with competent
              supervisory authorities.
              <br />
              d. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the
              data exporter shall, at the choice of the data importer, delete
              all personal data processed on behalf of the data importer and
              certify to the data importer that it has done so, or return to the
              data importer all personal data processed on its behalf and delete
              existing copies.
              <br />
              8.2 Security of processing
              <br />
              a. The Parties shall implement appropriate technical and
              organisational measures to ensure the security of the data,
              including during transmission, and protection against a breach of
              security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
              alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access (hereinafter
              ‘personal data breach’). In assessing the appropriate level of
              security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the
              costs of implementation, the nature of the personal data (7), the
              nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks
              involved in the processing for the data subjects, and in
              particular consider having recourse to encryption or
              pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose
              of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.
              <br />
              b. The data exporter shall assist the data importer in ensuring
              appropriate security of the data in accordance with paragraph (a).
              In case of a personal data breach concerning the personal data
              processed by the data exporter under these Clauses, the data
              exporter shall notify the data importer without undue delay after
              becoming aware of it and assist the data importer in addressing
              the breach.
              <br />
              c. The data exporter shall ensure that persons authorised to
              process the personal data have committed themselves to
              confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation
              of confidentiality.

              <br />
              a. OPTION 1: SPECIFIC PRIOR AUTHORISATION The data importer shall
              not sub-contract any of its processing activities performed on
              behalf of the data exporter under these Clauses to a sub-processor
              without the data exporter’s prior specific written authorisation.
              The data importer shall submit the request for specific
              authorisation at least [Specify time period] prior to the
              engagement of the sub-processor, together with the information
              necessary to enable the data exporter to decide on the
              authorisation. The list of sub-processors already authorised by
              the data exporter can be found in Annex III. The Parties shall
              keep Annex III up to date.
              <br />
              OPTION 2: GENERAL WRITTEN AUTHORISATION The data importer has the
              data exporter’s general authorisation for the engagement of
              sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data importer shall

              ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to
              which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.
              <br />
              c. The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter’s
              request, a copy of such a sub-processor agreement and any
              subsequent amendments to the data exporter. To the extent
              necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential
              information, including personal data, the data importer may redact
              the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.
              <br />
              d. The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data
              exporter for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations
              under its contract with the data importer. The data importer shall
              notify the data exporter of any failure by the sub-processor to
              fulfil its obligations under that contract.
              <br />
              e. The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause
              with the sub-processor whereby – in the event the data importer
              has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become
              insolvent – the data exporter shall have the right to terminate
              the sub-processor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to
              erase or return the personal data.

              specific authorisation at least [Specify time period] prior to the
              engagement of the sub-processor, together with the information
              necessary to enable the controller to decide on the authorisation.
              It shall inform the data exporter of such engagement. The list of

              c. The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter’s or
              controller’s request, a copy of such a sub-processor agreement and
              any subsequent amendments. To the extent necessary to protect
              business secrets or other confidential information, including
              personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the

              a. The data importer, where relevant with the assistance of the
              data exporter, shall deal with any enquiries and requests it
              receives from a data subject relating to the processing of his/her
              personal data and the exercise of his/her rights under these
              Clauses without undue delay and at the latest within one month of
              the receipt of the enquiry or request. (10) The data importer
              shall take appropriate measures to facilitate such enquiries,
              requests and the exercise of data subject rights. Any information
              provided to the data subject shall be in an intelligible and

              b. In particular, upon request by the data subject the data
              importer shall, free of charge: (i) provide confirmation to the
              data subject as to whether personal data concerning him/her is
              being processed and, where this is the case, a copy of the data
              relating to him/her and the information in Annex I; if personal
              data has been or will be onward transferred, provide information
              on recipients or categories of recipients (as appropriate with a
              view to providing meaningful information) to which the personal
              data has been or will be onward transferred, the purpose of such
              onward transfers and their ground pursuant to Clause 8.7; and
              provide information on the right to lodge a complaint with a
              supervisory authority in accordance with Clause 12(c)(i); (ii)
              rectify inaccurate or incomplete data concerning the data subject;
              (iii) erase personal data concerning the data subject if such data
              is being or has been processed in violation of any of these
              Clauses ensuring third-party beneficiary rights, or if the data
              subject withdraws the consent on which the processing is based.
              <br />
              c. Where the data importer processes the personal data for direct
              marketing purposes, it shall cease processing for such purposes if
              the data subject objects to it.
              <br />
              d. The data importer shall not make a decision based solely on the
              automated processing of the personal data transferred (hereinafter
              ‘automated decision’), which would produce legal effects
              concerning the data subject or similarly significantly affect
              him/her, unless with the explicit consent of the data subject or
              if authorised to do so under the laws of the country of
              destination, provided that such laws lays down suitable measures
              to safeguard the data subject’s rights and legitimate interests.
              In this case, the data importer shall, where necessary in
              cooperation with the data exporter: (i) inform the data subject
              about the envisaged automated decision, the envisaged consequences
              and the logic involved; and (ii) implement suitable safeguards, at
              least by enabling the data subject to contest the decision,
              express his/her point of view and obtain review by a human being.
              <br />
              e. Where requests from a data subject are excessive, in particular
              because of their repetitive character, the data importer may
              either charge a reasonable fee taking into account the
              administrative costs of granting the request or refuse to act on
              the request.
              <br />
              f. The data importer may refuse a data subject’s request if such
              refusal is allowed under the laws of the country of destination
              and is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to
              protect one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of
              Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
              <br />
              g. If the data importer intends to refuse a data subject’s
              request, it shall inform the data subject of the reasons for the
              refusal and the possibility of lodging a complaint with the
              competent supervisory authority and/or seeking judicial redress.

              <br />
              a. The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that
              the laws and practices in the third country of destination
              applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data
              importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or
              measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the
              data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses.
              This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that
              respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do
              not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic
              society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1)

              Clauses.
              <br />
              b. The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph
              (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following
              elements: (i) the specific circumstances of the transfer,
              including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors
              involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward
              transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the
              categories and format of the transferred personal data; the
              economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location
              of the data transferred; (ii) the laws and practices of the third
              country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure
              of data to public authorities or authorising access by such
              authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of
              the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards (12);
              (iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational
              safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these
              Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the
              processing of the personal data in the country of destination.
              <br />
              c. The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment
              under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the
              data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will
              continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring
              compliance with these Clauses.
              <br />
              d. The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph
              (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority
              on request.
              <br />
              e. The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly
              if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of
              the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become
              subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements
              under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of
              the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request)
              indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in
              line with the requirements in paragraph (a). [For Module Three:
              The data exporter shall forward the notification to the
              controller.]
              <br />
              f. Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the
              data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data
              importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses,
              the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures
              (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and
              confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data
              importer to address the situation [for Module Three:, if
              appropriate in consultation with the controller]. The data
              exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no
              appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if
              instructed by [for Module Three: the controller or] the competent
              supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter
              shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it
              concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If
              the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may
              exercise this right to termination only with respect to the
              relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where
              the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d)
              and (e) shall apply.

              notification to the controller.]
              <br />
              b. If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data
              exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of
              destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to
              obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating
              as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data
              importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able
              to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.
              <br />
              c. Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination,
              the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular
              intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant
              information as possible on the requests received (in particular,
              number of requests, type of data requested, requesting
              authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the

              to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make

              e. Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation
              of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to
              inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply
              with these Clauses.
              <br />
              15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation
              <br />
              a. The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request
              for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers
              granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the
              request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are
              reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under
              the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations
              under international law and principles of international comity.
              The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue
              possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data
              importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the
              effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has
              decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data
              requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural
              rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations
              of the data importer under Clause 14(e).
              <br />
              b. The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and
              any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent
              permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the
              documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make
              it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
              [For Module Three: The data exporter shall make the assessment
              available to the controller.]
              <br />
              c. The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of
              information permissible when responding to a request for
              disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

              relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.
              <br />
              d. [For Modules One, Two and Three: Personal data that has been
              transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to
              paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately
              be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The
              same shall apply to any copies of the data.] [For Module Four:
              Personal data collected by the data exporter in the EU that has
              been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant
              to paragraph (c) shall immediately be deleted in its entirety,
              including any copy thereof.] The data importer shall certify the
              deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is
              deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure
              compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to
              the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the
              transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will
              continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only
              process the data to the extent and for as long as required under
              that local law.
              <br />
              e. Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these
              Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision
              pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers
              the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or
              (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework
              of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is
              without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing
              in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

                  As regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance
                  with these Clauses, different elements may be considered as
                  part of an overall assessment. Such elements may include
                  relevant and documented practical experience with prior
                  instances of requests for disclosure from public authorities,
                  or the absence of such requests, covering a sufficiently
                  representative time-frame. This refers in particular to
                  internal records or other documentation, drawn up on a
                  continuous basis in accordance with due diligence and
                  certified at senior management level, provided that this
                  information can be lawfully shared with third parties. Where
                  this practical experience is relied upon to conclude that the
                  data importer will not be prevented from complying with these
                  Clauses, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective
                  elements, and it is for the Parties to consider carefully
                  whether these elements together carry sufficient weight, in
                  terms of their reliability and representativeness, to support
                  this conclusion. In particular, the Parties have to take into
                  account whether their practical experience is corroborated and
                  not contradicted by publicly available or otherwise
                  accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence
                  of requests within the same sector and/or the application of
                  the law in practice, such as case law and reports by
                  independent oversight bodies.
