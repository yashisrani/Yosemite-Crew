The foregoing sentence shall, however, not apply where the damage has been caused by, or has not been remedied with or because of, DuneXploration’s wilful intent, where DuneXploration had maliciously concealed a defect in the Products, in cases of injuries to life, limb or health, and/or where the corresponding claims result from the German Product Liability Act.

            </li>
            <li>
              If Uptime Percentage is 99.50% to 99.74% (inclusive) of the month’s minutes, Customer will be eligible for a credit of 7.5% of a monthly average fee derived from one-twelfth (1/12th) of the then-current annual fee paid to DuneXploration; or

              5.2.
            </strong>
             Customer shall only be eligible to request Service Level Credits if it notifies DuneXploration in writing within thirty (30) days from the end of the month for which Service Level Credits are due. All claims will be verified against DuneXploration’s system records. In the event after such notification DuneXploration determines that Service Level Credits are not due, or that different Service Level Credits are due, DuneXploration shall notify Customer in writing on that finding. Service Level Credits will be applied to the next invoice following Customer’s request and DuneXploration’s confirmation of available credits. Service Level Credits shall be Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy in the event of any failure to meet the Service Levels. DuneXploration will only provide records of system availability in response to good faith Customer claims.

            The Parties have concluded the “Yosemite Crew License and Subscription Terms (SaaS)” under which the Processor performs services for the Customer. For the performance of the services, it is necessary that the Processor processes personal data for and on behalf of the Controller.

            1. Application of the Standard Contractual Clauses
          </h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The Parties conclude the Standard Contractual Clauses between controllers and processors as agreed upon by the European Commission in its Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/915 of June 4 2021 and attached to this DPA as APPENDIX 1 (the “EU-Standard Contractual Clauses”). For clarity, Processor’s obligations and Controller’s rights concerning Personal Data apply even if the Personal Data relates to a data subject outside the European Union.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Parties agree upon including Clause 5 of the Standard Contractual Clauses and use OPTION 2 of Clause 7.7 regarding the general authorization of sub processors, whereas the time period in Clause 7.7 shall be 2 weeks. Regarding any other OPTIONS to choose from in the Clauses of the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Parties in each case agree upon OPTION 1.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Parties conclude the Standard Contractual Clauses, MODULE 4 (Processor to Controller) for the transfer of personal data to third countries pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as agreed upon by the European Commission in its Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021 and attached to this DPA as APPENDIX 2 (the “International Standard Contractual Clauses”). Regarding Clause 17 and Clause 18 (applicable law and jurisdiction) Germany is chosen each time. ANNEX 1 and 2 of APPENDIX 1 apply accordingly to describe the roles and the processing of personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
              The EU-Standard Contractual Clauses and International Standard Contractual Clauses will be supplemented by the provisions of this DPA.
            </li>
            <li>
              If any clause from this DPA or the Yosemite Crew License and Subscription Terms (SaaS) or any other related agreement between the Parties directly or indirectly contradicts the EU-Standard Contractual Clauses or International Standard Contractual Clauses, the respective Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail. If any clause from the EU-Standard Contractual Clauses directly or indirectly contradicts the International Standard Contractual Clauses, the International Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail.

The instruction shall be given either in written form (email to suffice). In case of an oral instruction, the Controller shall immediately confirm this instruction in written form (email to suffice).
            </li>
            <li>
              Instructions not foreseen in or covered by the Yosemite Crew License and Subscription Terms (SaaS) shall be treated as requests for change in performance. The Controller shall immediately confirm in writing or in text form any instruction issued orally.
            </li>

              In cases where the EU-Standard Contractual Clauses apply, the Controller shall give the Processor reasonable notice before conducting an audit according to Clause 7.6 of the EU-Standard Contractual Clauses unless such notice is impossible to provide or would defeat the purpose of the audit.
            </li>
            <li>
              In cases where the EU-Standard Contractual Clauses apply, Processor shall be entitled to request a remuneration for Processor’s support in conducting audits in accordance with the then current price list of Processor.
            </li>

              a. The purpose of these Standard Contractual Clauses (the Clauses) is to ensure compliance with [choose relevant option: OPTION 1: Article 28(3) and (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data] / [OPTION 2: Article 29(3) and (4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data].
            </p>
            <p>
              b. The controllers and processors listed in Annex I have agreed to these Clauses in order to ensure compliance with Article 28(3) and (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and/or Article 29 (3) and (4) Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.

            </p>
            <p>
              f. These Clauses do not by themselves ensure compliance with obligations related to international transfers in accordance with Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and/or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.

              a. The processor shall process personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject. In this case, the processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless the law prohibits this on important grounds of public interest. Subsequent instructions may also be given by the controller throughout the duration of the processing of personal data. These instructions shall always be documented.

              a. The processor shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex III to ensure the security of the personal data. This includes protecting the data against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to the data (personal data breach). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing and the risks involved for the data subjects.

              7.7. Use of sub-processors
            </div>
            <p>
              a. OPTION 1: PRIOR SPECIFIC AUTHORISATION: The processor shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the controller in accordance with these Clauses to a sub-processor, without the controller’s prior specific written authorisation. The processor shall submit the request for specific authorisation at least [SPECIFY TIME PERIOD] prior to the engagement of the sub-processor in question, together with the information necessary to enable the controller to decide on the authorisation. The list of sub-processors authorised by the controller can be found in Annex IV. The Parties shall keep Annex IV up to date.
            </p>
            <p>
              OPTION 2: GENERAL WRITTEN AUTHORISATION: The processor has the controller’s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processors from an agreed list. The processor shall specifically inform in writing the controller of any intended changes of that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least [SPECIFY TIME PERIOD] in advance, thereby giving the controller sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the concerned sub-processor(s). The processor shall provide the controller with the information necessary to enable the controller to exercise the right to object.
            </p>
            <p>
              b. Where the processor engages a sub-processor for carrying out specific processing activities (on behalf of the controller), it shall do so by way of a contract which imposes on the sub-processor, in substance, the same data protection obligations as the ones imposed on the data processor in accordance with these Clauses. The processor shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the processor is subject pursuant to these Clauses and to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and/or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.
            </p>
            <p>
              c. At the controller’s request, the processor shall provide a copy of such a sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the controller. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the processor may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing the copy.
            </p>
            <p>
              d. The processor shall remain fully responsible to the controller for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations in accordance with its contract with the processor. The processor shall notify the controller of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its contractual obligations.
            </p>
            <p>
              e. The processor shall agree a third party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby - in the event the processor has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent - the controller shall have the right to terminate the sub-processor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.

            <p>
              a. Any transfer of data to a third country or an international organisation by the processor shall be done only on the basis of documented instructions from the controller or in order to fulfil a specific requirement under Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject and shall take place in compliance with Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.
            </p>
            <p>
              b. The controller agrees that where the processor engages a sub-processor in accordance with Clause 7.7. for carrying out specific processing activities (on behalf of the controller) and those processing activities involve a transfer of personal data within the meaning of Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the processor and the sub-processor can ensure compliance with Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 by using standard contractual clauses adopted by the Commission in accordance with of Article 46(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, provided the conditions for the use of those standard contractual clauses are met.

              </li>
              <li>
                the obligation to consult the competent supervisory authority/ies prior to processing where a data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk;

              <li>
                the obligation to ensure that personal data is accurate and up to date, by informing the controller without delay if the processor becomes aware that the personal data it is processing is inaccurate or has become outdated;

                  <br />
                  We use strong encryption: data and volumes are encrypted at rest (AES-256) using AWS KMS, and in transit (TLS 1.3) across all services:
                  <br />

                      Encryption at rest our dev and prod instances, databases, snapshots and file stores are encrypted with AES-256 Encryption. Keys live in AWS KMS and rotate automatically every 12 months.

                    Measures for ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services
                  </strong>
                  <br />
                  Our systems are built on AWS using secure, highly available cloud architecture. We use encryption (TLS & AES-256), least-privilege IAM roles RBAC methodology, and network isolation to protect data. We use GitHub for secure source control, with enforced code reviews, signed commits, and audit logging to ensure code integrity: All changes are version-controlled, tested, and logged via CloudTrail to maintain integrity. Backups, regular disaster recovery tests, and alignment with AWS Well-Architected Framework ensure we stay resilient under pressure or failure. Continuous vulnerability management, container scans, weekly patched AMIs backup, annual VAPT penetration test.

                  <br />
                  (RBAC) Role based access control: We use role-based access control (RBAC) to make sure each person only sees the data they need for their job – right down to individual rows in the database if needed. We don’t allow shared logins, so every action can be clearly traced to a specific user. Session management – We manage user sessions securely using encrypted tokens. If someone’s inactive for 15 minutes, they’re logged out automatically, and all sessions end after 12 hours no matter what — this helps reduce the risk from forgotten or unattended logins.

                    Measures for the protection of data during transmission
                  </strong>
                  <br />
                  All data on AWS cloud instances volumes are encrypted using the latest and most secure standard. We’ve disabled older, weaker encryption methods to keep communications safe. For our mobile apps, we use certificate pinning to make sure the app only talks to our real servers — this helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. In sensitive industries like healthcare or legal, we offer full end-to-end encryption so that even we can’t see the data in transit. When it comes to file transfers, we use secure methods like SFTP with strong SSH keys or short-lived HTTPS download links that session ends after 30 minutes to prevent unauthorized access.

                    Measures for ensuring events logging
                  </strong>
                  <br />
                  We track all key activities across our systems using AWS CloudWatch and GitHub audit logs. In AWS, CloudWatch logs cover everything from API calls and network activity to system performance and security events. Combined with services like CloudTrail and GuardDuty, this helps us detect and respond to threats quickly. On the development side, GitHub audit logs let us monitor actions like code pushes, permission changes, and access to repositories — ensuring we have full traceability of who did what, and when. All logs are stored securely, protected from tampering, and kept according to our retention policy. We review them regularly and have automated alerts for anything suspicious, so our security team can act fast if something’s not right.

                    Measures for ensuring system configuration, including default configuration
                  </strong>
                  <br />
                  Our systems are built with security in mind from the ground up. We use infrastructure a -code tools (like Terraform and Ansible) to ensure all environments are configured consistently and securely. Servers and containers are based on hardened images that follow industry standards (like CIS Benchmarks), with only the necessary services and ports enabled. Encryption is turned on by default, and insecure protocols are disabled. We regularly apply security updates and critical API patches, so we don’t fall behind. System settings are continuously monitored to catch any drift from our secure baseline.

                  <br />
                  We follow IT Security & Compliance standards like ISO 27001:2022 and SOC 2 to keep our systems and data secure. Our Information Security Management System (ISMS) is aligned with ISO 27001:2022, and we have a dedicated Data Protection Officer (DPO) and a Security Steering Committee that reports quarterly to senior leadership. We carry out regular risk assessments, including a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) at project launch and updates after any major technical or architectural changes. All team members complete mandatory cyber security and privacy training during onboarding and annually thereafter.

                      As part of this process, we’ve already implemented many of the required controls across our infrastructure, development, and data handling processes. We’re also working closely with external auditors to ensure everything meets or exceeds industry expectations.

                  We generally do not store personal data unless it’s strictly necessary for the functionality of our application. When personal data is required, we collect only what’s needed — no more, no less. Every feature goes through a privacy-by-design review to ensure we’re limiting the type, amount, and duration of personal data used. Where possible, we replace identifiers with pseudonyms or anonymised values, and we use aggregated data for analytics and reporting.

                  <br />
                  We take accountability seriously and have put processes in place to make sure data protection and security responsibilities are clear, monitored, and auditable. All roles and responsibilities related to data handling and security are formally defined, with oversight from our Data Protection Officer (DPO) and Security Steering Committee. We maintain detailed records of processing activities (RoPA) and conduct regular internal audits to ensure we’re following our policies and meeting legal requirements.

                We carefully vet all sub-processors before working with them, especially when they handle personal data on our behalf. Each sub-processor must sign a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) that clearly sets out their responsibilities, including support for the controller’s obligations under GDPR. Sub-processors are required to implement equivalent technical and organisational measures as we do — including encryption of data in transit and at rest, access controls, security logging, and staff training. We also require that they only process data under documented instructions and never for their own purposes. To ensure transparency and compliance: Sub-processors must promptly assist us (and therefore the controller) with requests from data subjects, such as access, rectification, or deletion. They must notify us of any data breach without undue delay, allowing us to meet the 72-hour GDPR notification window. They are required to undergo regular security audits (ISO 27001 or SOC 2) and provide evidence on request.

                8.1 Purpose limitation
                <br />
                The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B. It may only process the personal data for another purpose: (i) where it has obtained the data subject’s prior consent; (ii) where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or (iii) where necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
                <br />
                8.2 Transparency
                <br />
                a. In order to enable data subjects to effectively exercise their rights pursuant to Clause 10, the data importer shall inform them, either directly or through the data exporter: (i) of its identity and contact details; (ii) of the categories of personal data processed; (iii) of the right to obtain a copy of these Clauses; (iv) where it intends to onward transfer the personal data to any third party/ies, of the recipient or categories of recipients (as appropriate with a view to providing meaningful information), the purpose of such onward transfer and the ground therefore pursuant to Clause 8.7.
                <br />
                b. Paragraph (a) shall not apply where the data subject already has the information, including when such information has already been provided by the data exporter, or providing the information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort for the data importer. In the latter case, the data importer shall, to the extent possible, make the information publicly available.
                <br />
                c. On request, the Parties shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by them, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the Parties may redact part of the text of the Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.
                <br />
                d. Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
                <br />
                8.3 Accuracy and data minimisation
                <br />
                a. Each Party shall ensure that the personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The data importer shall take every reasonable step to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purpose(s) of processing, is erased or rectified without delay.
                <br />
                b. If one of the Parties becomes aware that the personal data it has transferred or received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the other Party without undue delay.
                <br />
                c. The data importer shall ensure that the personal data is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose(s) of processing.
                <br />
                8.4 Storage limitation
                <br />
                The data importer shall retain the personal data for no longer than necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is processed. It shall put in place appropriate technical or organisational measures to ensure compliance with this obligation, including erasure or anonymisation (2) of the data and all back-ups at the end of the retention period.
                <br />
                8.5 Security of processing
                <br />
                a. The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the personal data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing the appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subject. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.
                <br />
                b. The Parties have agreed on the technical and organisational measures set out in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.
                <br />
                c. The data importer shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
                <br />
                d. In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the personal data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.
                <br />
                e. In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall without undue delay notify both the data exporter and the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13. Such notification shall contain i) a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), ii) its likely consequences, iii) the measures taken or proposed to address the breach, and iv) the details of a contact point from whom more information can be obtained. To the extent it is not possible for the data importer to provide all the information at the same time, it may do so in phases without undue further delay.
                <br />
                f. In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall also notify without undue delay the data subjects concerned of the personal data breach and its nature, if necessary in cooperation with the data exporter, together with the information referred to in paragraph (e), points ii) to iv), unless the data importer has implemented measures to significantly reduce the risk to the rights or freedoms of natural persons, or notification would involve disproportionate efforts. In the latter case, the data importer shall instead issue a public communication or take a similar measure to inform the public of the personal data breach.
                <br />
                g. The data importer shall document all relevant facts relating to the personal data breach, including its effects and any remedial action taken, and keep a record thereof.
                <br />
                8.6 Sensitive data
                <br />
                Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions or offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards adapted to the specific nature of the data and the risks involved. This may include restricting the personnel permitted to access the personal data, additional security measures (such as pseudonymisation) and/or additional restrictions with respect to further disclosure.
                <br />
                8.7 Onward transfers
                <br />
                The data importer shall not disclose the personal data to a third party located outside the European Union (3) (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward transfer’) unless the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module. Otherwise, an onward transfer by the data importer may only take place if: (i) it is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer; (ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question; (iii) the third party enters into a binding instrument with the data importer ensuring the same level of data protection as under these Clauses, and the data importer provides a copy of these safeguards to the data exporter; iv) it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; (v) it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; or (vi) where none of the other conditions apply, the data importer has obtained the explicit consent of the data subject for an onward transfer in a specific situation, after having informed him/her of its purpose(s), the identity of the recipient and the possible risks of such transfer to him/her due to the lack of appropriate data protection safeguards. In this case, the data importer shall inform the data exporter and, at the request of the latter, shall transmit to it a copy of the information provided to the data subject. Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.

                (a) The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.
                <br />
                (b) The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.

                On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
                <br />
                8.4. Accuracy
                <br />
                If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.
                <br />
                8.5. Duration of processing and erasure or return of data
                <br />
                Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).
                <br />
                8.6. Security of processing
                <br />
                a. The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.
                <br />
                b. The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
                <br />
                c. In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.
                <br />
                d. The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.

                <br />
                The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (4) (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward transfer’) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if: (i) the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer; (ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question; (iii) the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or (iv) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.

                <br />
                b. The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.
                <br />
                c. The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter’s request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.
                <br />
                d. The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.
                <br />
                e. The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

Such additional instructions shall not conflict with the instructions from the controller. The controller or data exporter may give further documented instructions regarding the data processing throughout the duration of the contract.
                <br />
                c. The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions. Where the data importer is unable to follow the instructions from the controller, the data exporter shall immediately notify the controller.
                <br />
                d. The data exporter warrants that it has imposed the same data protection obligations on the data importer as set out in the contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law between the controller and the data exporter (5).
                <br />
                8.2 Purpose limitation
                <br />
                The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B., unless on further instructions from the controller, as communicated to the data importer by the data exporter, or from the data exporter.
                <br />
                8.3 Transparency
                <br />
                On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.
                <br />
                8.4 Accuracy
                <br />
                If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to rectify or erase the data.
                <br />
                8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data
                <br />
                Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the controller and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).
                <br />
                8.6 Security of processing
                <br />
                a. The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing the appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subject. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter or the controller. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.
                <br />
                b. The data importer shall grant access to the data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
                <br />
                c. In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify, without undue delay, the data exporter and, where appropriate and feasible, the controller after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.
                <br />
                d. The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify its controller so that the latter may in turn notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.
                <br />
                8.7 Sensitive data
                <br />
                Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards set out in Annex I.B.
                <br />
                8.8 Onward transfers
                <br />
                The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the controller, as communicated to the data importer by the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (6) (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward transfer’) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if: (i) the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer; (ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679; (iii) the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or (iv) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.
                <br />
                8.9 Documentation and compliance
                <br />
                a. The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter or the controller that relate to the processing under these Clauses.
                <br />
                b. The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the controller.
                <br />
                c. The data importer shall make all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses available to the data exporter, which shall provide it to the controller.
                <br />
                d. The data importer shall allow for and contribute to audits by the data exporter of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. The same shall apply where the data exporter requests an audit on instructions of the controller. In deciding on an audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.
                <br />
                e. Where the audit is carried out on the instructions of the controller, the data exporter shall make the results available to the controller.
                <br />
                f. The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.
                <br />
                g. The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

OPTION 1: SPECIFIC PRIOR AUTHORISATION The data importer shall not sub-contract any of its processing activities performed on behalf of the data exporter under these Clauses to a sub-processor without the data exporter’s prior specific written authorisation. The data importer shall submit the request for specific authorisation at least [Specify time period] prior to the engagement of the sub-processor, together with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to decide on the authorisation. The list of sub-processors already authorised by the data exporter can be found in Annex III. The Parties shall keep Annex III up to date.
                <br />
                OPTION 2: GENERAL WRITTEN AUTHORISATION The data importer has the data exporter’s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least [Specify time period] in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s).

                <br />
                b. Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects. (8) The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.

                <br />
                a. The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.
                <br />
                b. The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements: (i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred; (ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards (12); (iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.
                <br />
                c. The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.
                <br />
                d. The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
                <br />
                e. The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a). [For Module Three: The data exporter shall forward the notification to the controller.]
                <br />
                f. Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation [for Module Three:, if appropriate in consultation with the controller]. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by [for Module Three: the controller or] the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.

                a. The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it: (i) receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or (ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer. [For Module Three: The data exporter shall forward the notification to the controller.]
                <br />
                b. If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.
                <br />
                c. Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.). [For Module Three: The data exporter shall forward the information to the controller.]
                <br />
                d. The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
                <br />
                e. Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.
                <br />
                15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation
                <br />
                a. The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).
                <br />
                b. The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request. [For Module Three: The data exporter shall make the assessment available to the controller.]
                <br />
                c. The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

                a. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.
                <br />
                b. In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).
                <br />
                c. The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where: (i) the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension; (ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or (iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses. In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority [for Module Three: and the controller] of such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.
                <br />
                d. [For Modules One, Two and Three: Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data.] [For Module Four: Personal data collected by the data exporter in the EU that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall immediately be deleted in its entirety, including any copy thereof.] The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.
                <br />
                e. Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

                    Where the data exporter is a processor subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 acting on behalf of a Union institution or body as controller, reliance on these Clauses when engaging another processor (sub-processing) not subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 also ensures compliance with Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39), to the extent these Clauses and the data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor pursuant to Article 29(3) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 are aligned. This will in particular be the case where the controller and processor rely on the standard contractual clauses included in Decision 2021/915.

                    This requires rendering the data anonymous in such a way that the individual is no longer identifiable by anyone, in line with recital 26 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and that this process is irreversible.

                    The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union’s internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose of these Clauses.

                    This includes whether the transfer and further processing involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions or offences.

                    That period may be extended by a maximum of two more months, to the extent necessary taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The data importer shall duly and promptly inform the data subject of any such extension.

                    As regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with these Clauses, different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment. Such elements may include relevant and documented practical experience with prior instances of requests for disclosure from public authorities, or the absence of such requests, covering a sufficiently representative time-frame. This refers in particular to internal records or other documentation, drawn up on a continuous basis in accordance with due diligence and certified at senior management level, provided that this information can be lawfully shared with third parties. Where this practical experience is relied upon to conclude that the data importer will not be prevented from complying with these Clauses, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective elements, and it is for the Parties to consider carefully whether these elements together carry sufficient weight, in terms of their reliability and representativeness, to support this conclusion. In particular, the Parties have to take into account whether their practical experience is corroborated and not contradicted by publicly available or otherwise accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence of requests within the same sector and/or the application of the law in practice, such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies.
